# Digital Clock Project

This project is a simple web-based digital clock that displays the current time and date, updated every second. The clock is built using HTML, CSS (via Bootstrap), and JavaScript.

## Features

- Displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Shows the current date.
- The time and date update every second in real-time.
- Responsive design using Bootstrap framework.
- Includes a navigation bar and a jumbotron component for a clean, modern interface.

## How It Works

1. **JavaScript Functionality:**
    - The current date and time are retrieved using the `Date()` object.
    - The time is formatted in `HH:MM:SS` and updated every second using `setInterval()`.
    - The result is displayed in the `span` element with the ID `time`.

2. **Bootstrap for Styling:**
    - Bootstrap 4 is used for a responsive layout.
    - A navigation bar, jumbotron, and buttons are styled using Bootstrap classes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling is enhanced with Bootstrap.
- **JavaScript**: For real-time clock updates.
- **Bootstrap**: Provides responsive design and layout elements.

## How to Use

2. Open the `Digital_Clock.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. The current time and date will be displayed and updated automatically every second.
